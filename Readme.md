# ReeTech
ReeTech is a web application that aids in recycling electronic waste.  

Some of its features include a Victoria-wide map on where to recycle electronic waste that is can be tailored to your needs, webpages that inform you on the negative effects of electronic waste and a page to make a collection request of electronic waste around your neighbourhood.

Here are some snippets of the web app in action!
